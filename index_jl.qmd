# Welcome to my website!

My name is Jeff Lambe. I am a neuroimmunology fellow at the Cleveland Clinic.

I was born and raised in Ireland, where I graduated from University College Dublin medical school in 2015. I spent the following three years completing basic specialist training in Dublin (Saint Vincent's University Hospital and Saint James's Hospital), before moving to the US in 2018. I initially moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where I completed a two-year post-doctoral research fellowship in neuroimmunology in Johns Hopkins Hospital. I then moved to Cleveland, Ohio, in 2020 to complete neurology residency at the Cleveland Clinic. I am currently completing a two-year research fellowship at the Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis.

My primary research interest in in the development and validation of imaging biomarkers of neurodegenration and remyelination in multiple sclerosis.
