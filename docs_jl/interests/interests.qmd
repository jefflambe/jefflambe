#Sports

##Football
-I've been a devout Chelsea fan since the days of Ruud Gullit and Gianfranco Zola.
-I play sometimes at an ever-lowering level at left-back.

##Rugby
-Leinster, but- most importantly- Irish rugby.
-I used to play, but not for long, and I was never good.

##Golf
-Rory McIlroy's mental yips have taken years off my life.
-I would love to play more- maybe after retirement.

#Music
-I never outgrew my music taste from my teenage years, so it's emo/pop-punk all the way.
-One of the better parts of living in America is seeing my favorite bands on tour.
