# Welcome to my website!

My name is Jeff Lambe. I am an Irish neuroimmunology fellow at the Cleveland Clinic. I am currently studying for a masters degree in clinical research through Case Western Reserve University. My primary research interest is in the development and validation of imaging biomarkers of neurodegeneration and remyelination in multiple sclerosis.
